CALL CENTER DASHBOARD

OVERVIEW:

This Power BI project analyzes call center performance using metrics like call volume, sentiment analysis, response time, and state-level distribution. The dashboards provide insights into trends, sentiment breakdowns, SLA adherence, and performance by communication channels.

QUESTIONS

CALL VOLUME INSIGHTS:

1.Which day has the highest and lowest call volumes?

2.What is the trend of call volumes across the month?

SENTIMENTS ANALYSIS:

1.What are the sentiment trends (Positive, Negative, Neutral) for different reasons like billing, payments, and service outages?

2.How does response time affect sentiment ratings?

CHANNEL AND SLA ANALYSIS:

How many calls are handled across different channels (Call Center, Email, Chatbot, Web)?

What is the response time distribution within, above, and below SLA?

GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION:

Which states have the highest and lowest call volumes?

PERFORMANCE METRICS:

What is the total call duration and average call duration per day?

What is the CSAT (Customer Satisfaction Score) rating?
